# jQuery Server Calculator

## Description

*Duration: 1 Week*

In this project a user can input two values (2 input elements) and select add ( + ), subtract ( - ), multiply ( * ) or divide( / ). When the submit ( = ) button is clicked, the inputs are captured and sent to the server for calculation via POST. A GET request is then performed to append the results to the DOM. There is a clear ( 'C' ) button that will clear inputs and the selected operator. A history of all calculations is displayed on the DOM.
